This module has not *yet* been written
(*because we are currently at*
[***full-tilt***](http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/full-tilt.html)
*on other projects*...)

We need your help to write code!
If you are looking for an *especially* big challenge,
that will win you an *insane* amount of #InternetPoints and
probably make you famous on GitHub, Reddit, HackerNews, etc
and earn some ***Real World Cash****
